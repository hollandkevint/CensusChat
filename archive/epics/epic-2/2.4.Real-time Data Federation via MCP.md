## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Based on existing DuckDB infrastructure and healthcare analytics module:

**New Files to Create:**
- **`/backend/src/services/dataRefreshService.ts`** - User-triggered data refresh functionality
- **`/frontend/src/components/DataRefreshButton.tsx`** - Simple refresh UI component
- **`/backend/src/routes/dataRefresh.routes.ts`** - Data refresh API endpoints
- **`/backend/src/utils/dataFreshnessTracker.ts`** - Track and display data freshness

**Files to Modify:**
- **`/backend/src/utils/censusDataLoader.ts`** (from Story 2.1) - Enhance for user-triggered refresh
- **`/backend/src/modules/healthcare_analytics/index.ts`** (from Story 2.3) - Add refresh capability
- **`/frontend/src/pages/HealthcareAnalytics.tsx`** - Add refresh UI components

### Technical Implementation Details

**User-Triggered Data Refresh Architecture:**

**1. Simple Data Refresh Service:**
```typescript
export class DataRefreshService {
  async refreshHealthcareData(): Promise<{
    success: boolean;
    duration: number;
    recordsUpdated: number;
    error?: string;
  }> {
    // Leverage existing data loading from Story 2.1
    // Update healthcare datasets in DuckDB
    // Provide progress feedback
  }
}
```

**2. Basic DuckDB Data Loading:**
```sql
-- Refresh healthcare demographic data
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO healthcare_demographics
SELECT * FROM read_csv('/data/updated/acs_healthcare_2023.csv');

-- Update facility data
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO healthcare_facilities
SELECT * FROM read_csv('/data/updated/healthcare_facilities_2023.csv');
```

**3. Data Freshness Tracking:**
```typescript
interface DataFreshness {
  dataset: string;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  recordCount: number;
  status: 'fresh' | 'stale' | 'refreshing';
}
```

### Dependencies on Previous Stories

**Story 2.1 (DuckDB Connection Pool) - Critical:**
- Data refresh requires stable DuckDB environment and connection pooling
- Existing data loading utilities provide foundation for refresh functionality

**Story 2.3 (Healthcare SQL Patterns) - Critical:**
- Healthcare analytics module must continue working with refreshed data
- Existing SQL patterns and performance optimization support data refresh operations

**Story 2.2 (MCP Server Integration) - Optional:**
- Basic MCP capabilities may be useful for future enhancements
- Not required for simple file-based data refresh functionality

### MVP Healthcare Use Cases

**Simple Healthcare Analytics with Data Refresh:**
- User refreshes data when needed (monthly/quarterly)
- Medicare Advantage analysis using existing healthcare analytics from Story 2.3
- Healthcare facility adequacy with current data
- Population health analysis with up-to-date demographics

**User Experience:**
- Click "Refresh Data" button when updates are needed
- System shows progress during refresh process
- Healthcare analytics work with refreshed data
- Clear indicators show data freshness

### Simple Performance Considerations

**Data Refresh Optimization:**
- Leverage existing performance optimization from Story 2.3
- Use transaction-based updates to prevent data corruption
- Provide progress feedback during longer refresh operations
- Maintain system availability during refresh process

**Basic Caching:**
- Healthcare analytics results remain cached as implemented in Story 2.3
- Simple data freshness indicators show age of data
- No complex TTL management needed for MVP

### Simple Error Handling and User Experience

**Refresh Error Handling:**
- Clear user-friendly error messages for failed refresh operations
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures (network timeouts)
- System remains operational even if refresh fails
- Rollback to previous data state if refresh corrupts data

**User Feedback:**
- Progress indicators during refresh process
- Success/failure notifications
- Clear messaging about data status and age
- Simple troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### Basic Data Quality

**Simple Data Freshness:**
- "Last updated" timestamps displayed in analytics results
- Basic freshness indicators (fresh/stale/refreshing status)
- Clear indication of when data refresh is needed
- Simple data source attribution in results

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Simple Integration with Healthcare Analytics:**
```typescript
// Healthcare analytics continue to work unchanged
const analysis = await anthropicService.analyzeQuery(query);

// Add simple data freshness information
const dataFreshness = await dataFreshnessTracker.getDataAge();
const results = await healthcareAnalytics.executeQuery(analysis.queryPattern);

// Include freshness info in response
return {
  ...results,
  dataFreshness: dataFreshness
};
```

**Minimal Changes Required:**
- Healthcare analytics from Story 2.3 continue to work unchanged
- Data refresh service operates independently
- Simple UI addition for refresh functionality
