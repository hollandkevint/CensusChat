## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Based on existing CensusChat infrastructure and healthcare analytics:

**New Files to Create:**
- **`/backend/src/routes/health.routes.ts`** - Basic health check endpoints
- **`/backend/src/services/basicMonitoringService.ts`** - Simple system health monitoring
- **`/frontend/src/components/SystemStatus.tsx`** - Basic system status display
- **`/backend/src/utils/errorLogger.ts`** - Enhanced error logging utility

**Files to Modify:**
- **`/backend/src/routes/query.routes.ts`** - Add basic performance tracking
- **`/backend/src/modules/healthcare_analytics/index.ts`** (from Story 2.3) - Add health status
- **`/frontend/src/pages/HealthcareAnalytics.tsx`** - Add system status indicators

### Technical Implementation Details

**Simple Health Check Implementation:**

**Basic Health Check Service:**
```typescript
export class BasicHealthService {
  async getSystemHealth(): Promise<{
    status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'down';
    components: {
      database: boolean;
      healthcareAnalytics: boolean;
      dataFreshness: string;
    };
    timestamp: Date;
  }> {
    // Check DuckDB connection
    // Verify healthcare analytics module
    // Get data freshness from Story 2.4
  }
}
```

**Simple Performance Tracking:**
- Basic query response times
- Simple success/failure counting
- Error logging with categorization
- System component status
- Leverage existing performance optimization from Story 2.3

### Dependencies on Previous Stories

**Story 2.1 (DuckDB Connection Pool) - Critical:**
- Health checks need stable connection pool to verify database status
- Connection pool health is a key system component

**Story 2.3 (Healthcare SQL Patterns) - Critical:**
- Performance optimization already implemented in Story 2.3
- Healthcare analytics module provides health status
- Existing caching and optimization support basic monitoring needs

**Story 2.4 (User-Triggered Data Refresh) - Optional:**
- Data freshness indicators enhance system status
- Basic monitoring can show refresh status

**Story 2.2 (MCP Server Integration) - Optional:**
- MCP health can be included in overall system status if implemented

### Simple Monitoring Approach

**Basic System Status:**
- Use existing performance optimization from Story 2.3
- Simple health checks for key components
- Basic error logging and categorization
- No complex caching management needed for MVP

**MVP Monitoring Focus:**
- System is working / not working
- Healthcare analytics are operational
- Basic performance metrics (response times)
- Simple error tracking
- Data freshness indicators

### Basic Health Indicators

**Simple Status Components:**
1. **Database Status:** DuckDB connection healthy/unhealthy
2. **Healthcare Analytics:** Module operational status
3. **Data Status:** Freshness indicators from Story 2.4
4. **Basic Performance:** Average response times
5. **Error Status:** Recent error count and types

**Simple Thresholds:**
- Response time > 5 seconds: Show warning
- Database connection failed: Show error
- Healthcare analytics unavailable: Show error
- High error rate (>20 errors/hour): Show warning

### Simple Error Handling

**Basic Error Categories:**
1. **System Errors:** Database connection failures, server unavailable
2. **User Errors:** Invalid queries, bad input parameters
3. **Data Errors:** Data loading failures, corrupt data
4. **Performance Errors:** Query timeouts, slow responses

**Simple Error Tracking:**
- Log errors with timestamp and category
- Count errors per hour/day
- Display error status in health check
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### MVP Integration Approach

**Leverage Existing Work:**
- Story 2.3 already implemented comprehensive performance optimization
- Use existing caching and monitoring from healthcare analytics module
- Add basic health endpoints and status indicators
- Keep monitoring simple and focused on MVP needs

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Simple Health Check Integration:**
```typescript
// Basic health check endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const health = await basicHealthService.getSystemHealth();
  const status = health.status === 'healthy' ? 200 : 503;
  res.status(status).json(health);
});

// Add basic timing to existing query processing
const startTime = Date.now();
const result = await processQuery(query);
const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;

// Log performance if slow
if (responseTime > 5000) {
  logger.warn('Slow query detected', { responseTime, query });
}
```

**Minimal Integration Required:**
- Add health check endpoint to existing routing
- Enhance existing error logging
- Use performance optimization already in Story 2.3
- Keep changes minimal for MVP

### Simple Production Considerations

**MVP Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- Basic health check endpoints for uptime monitoring
- Simple log files for error tracking
- Use existing infrastructure from CensusChat
- No complex monitoring systems required for MVP

**Basic Scalability Awareness:**
- Monitor database connection usage
- Track basic memory usage patterns
- Watch for error rate increases
- Simple capacity indicators (connection pool usage)

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- `/backend/src/__tests__/services/basicMonitoringService.test.ts` - Basic monitoring tests
- `/backend/src/__tests__/utils/errorLogger.test.ts` - Error logging tests

**Testing Framework:**
- **Jest** - Primary testing framework
- **Health Check Testing** - Validate health endpoint responses
- **Error Logging Testing** - Verify error categorization and logging

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. **Health Check Tests:** Validate health endpoint returns correct status
2. **Error Logging Tests:** Ensure errors are categorized and logged properly
3. **Basic Performance Tests:** Check response time tracking works
4. **Integration Tests:** Verify monitoring works with healthcare analytics
5. **Status Indicator Tests:** Test system status displays correctly

**Simple Test Scenarios:**
- Health check returns status when system is healthy/unhealthy
- Error logging captures different error types
- Performance tracking logs slow queries
- System status indicators show correct component status
- Integration with existing healthcare analytics works
