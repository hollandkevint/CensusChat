# CensusChat - Natural Language Census Data Query Platform

**Status:** Early Development  
**Methodology:** BMAD B2B Data Products Framework  
**License:** Open Source (TBD)

## Overview

CensusChat is an open-source platform that democratizes access to US Census data through natural language queries. By combining Census API data with DuckDB performance optimization and Model Context Protocol (MCP), users can explore demographic insights using plain English instead of complex SQL or API calls.

## Problem Statement

US Census data contains invaluable insights for researchers, analysts, journalists, and policy makers, but accessing and querying this data requires deep technical knowledge of Census APIs, complex data structures, and SQL. This barrier prevents many potential users from leveraging this public resource for data-driven decision making.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Data analysts, researchers (academic, policy, journalism), civic technologists
- **Secondary:** Students, small government agencies, non-profit organizations
- **Market Size:** ~560K potential users across data professionals, researchers, and journalists

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English, get Census data insights
- **High Performance**: Sub-second responses on 11M+ census records via DuckDB optimization  
- **Comprehensive Data**: Access to US Census ACS 5-year detailed tables (250+ tables, 10K+ variables)
- **Security First**: SQL validation restricts queries to SELECT statements only
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparent operations

### Technical Stack
- **Data Processing**: DuckDB for high-performance analytical queries
- **API Integration**: US Census API for ACS 5-year detailed tables
- **Natural Language Interface**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
- **Query Validation**: SQL parser for security and safety
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed queries
- **Web Interface**: React/Next.js for user dashboard

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Freemium SaaS**: Basic queries free, advanced features paid ($9-49/month)
2. **Usage-based API**: Pay-per-query for developers ($0.01-0.10 per query)
3. **Enterprise Licensing**: Custom deployments ($10K-100K annually)
4. **Training/Consulting**: Data analysis training and research projects ($150-300/hour)

### Pricing Strategy
- **Free Tier**: 100 queries/month
- **Pro Tier**: $19/month for 10K queries + advanced features
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing starting at $500/month

## Development Methodology

This project follows the **BMAD B2B Data Products Framework**, ensuring systematic development from concept to market with focus on:

- Data asset value optimization
- Service layer design for user success
- Platform capabilities for scale
- Trust and security frameworks
- Ecosystem development for growth
