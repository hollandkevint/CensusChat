## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable code
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality

### Commit Messages

We use conventional commits. Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
- `feat(api): add census data filtering`
- `fix(query): handle malformed natural language input`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use ESLint for linting
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

## Security

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to security@censuschat.org

## Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
