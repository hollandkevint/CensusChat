  ## PROJECT CONTEXT
  Create a professional healthcare SaaS landing page for CensusChat - a natural language interface to US Census data targeting healthcare
  strategy teams. This is a B2B conversion-focused landing page that transforms expensive demographic consulting ($50K, 6 weeks) into instant
  AI-powered queries ($297/month, 23 minutes).

  **Tech Stack**: HTML5, CSS3 (or Tailwind CSS), vanilla JavaScript
  **Target Audience**: Healthcare business analysts, strategy teams, executives at health systems and Medicare Advantage plans
  **Visual Style**: Clean, professional, healthcare-industry appropriate with trustworthy medical aesthetics. Use blue (#3B82F6) as primary
  color with green accents (#10B981) for success metrics, purple (#8B5CF6) for AI/technology features.

  ## HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
  Create a mobile-first, conversion-optimized landing page that immediately communicates the value proposition: "Stop Wasting $50K on 6-Week
  Demographic Reports" and drives healthcare professionals to request early access or schedule demos.
