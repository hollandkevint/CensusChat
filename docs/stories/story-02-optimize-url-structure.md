# Story: Optimize URL Structure and Routing

<!-- Source: GitHub Pages URL optimization requirements -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to improve user experience -->

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story

As a healthcare professional sharing the CensusChat landing page,
I want a clean, professional URL structure,
so that the link looks trustworthy and is easy to remember.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Clean URL structure like `/CensusChat/about` or `/CensusChat/`
2. ✅ Old URLs redirect properly to new structure
3. ✅ All internal links updated to use new URL structure
4. ✅ No broken links anywhere in the site
5. ✅ Jekyll configuration supports the new routing
6. ✅ SEO metadata preserved with URL change

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context
- Current file: `/docs/GITHUB_PAGE.md`
- Current URL: https://hollandkevint.github.io/CensusChat/GITHUB_PAGE.html
- Jekyll configuration: `/docs/_config.yml`
- Internal links in: README.md, index.md, landing pages

### Integration Approach
1. Use Jekyll permalink configuration for clean URLs
2. Set up redirects from old URLs using Jekyll redirect or meta refresh
3. Update all internal links systematically
4. Test all link changes

### Technical Constraints
- GitHub Pages has limited plugin support
- Must maintain existing Jekyll configuration
- Cannot break existing external links if possible

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Configure Clean URL Structure
  - [x] Update Jekyll front matter in `/docs/GITHUB_PAGE.md`
  - [x] Set permalink to `/about/` as appropriate
  - [x] Test URL structure works with GitHub Pages

- [x] Task 2: Set Up URL Redirects
  - [x] Add meta refresh redirect from old URL
  - [x] Created `/docs/GITHUB_PAGE.html` redirect file
  - [x] Test old URL redirects to new URL properly

- [x] Task 3: Update Internal Links
  - [x] Find all references to old URL structure in:
    - `/README.md` ✅
    - `/docs/index.md` ✅
    - `/docs/landing/executives.md` ✅
    - `/docs/landing/developers.md` ✅
    - All other files with links ✅
  - [x] Update links to use new URL structure
  - [x] Use relative links where appropriate

- [x] Task 4: Verify Jekyll Configuration
  - [x] Review `/docs/_config.yml` for any needed updates
  - [x] Ensure permalink structure is supported
  - [x] Test Jekyll build with new configuration

- [x] Task 5: Test All Links
  - [x] Build site locally and test all navigation
  - [x] Verify external links still work
  - [x] Check that no 404 errors exist
  - [x] Test redirect from old URL works

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing links or causing 404 errors
- **Mitigation**: Systematic testing of all links, redirect setup
- **Verification**: Complete site navigation test

### Rollback Plan
- Git revert URL changes
- Restore original link structure
- GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically

### Safety Checks
- [ ] All internal links tested and working
- [ ] Old URLs redirect properly
- [ ] No 404 errors found
- [ ] Jekyll build succeeds

## Definition of Done

- [x] Clean URL structure implemented
- [x] Old URLs redirect to new structure
- [x] All internal links updated and working
- [x] Jekyll configuration supports new routing
- [x] No broken links in entire site
- [x] SEO metadata preserved
