## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Based on Epic 2 requirements and MCP integration documentation:

**New Files to Create:**
- **`/backend/src/services/mcpServerService.ts`** - MCP server management
- **`/backend/src/services/mcpClientService.ts`** - External MCP connections
- **`/backend/src/utils/mcpTools.ts`** - Healthcare analytics MCP tools
- **`/backend/src/config/mcpConfig.ts`** - MCP server configuration

**Integration Points:**
- **`/backend/src/routes/query.routes.ts`** - Add MCP tool calls to existing query processing
- **`/backend/src/utils/duckdbPool.ts`** (from Story 2.1) - Add MCP extension loading
- **`/backend/src/index.ts`** - Integrate MCP server lifecycle

### Technical Implementation Details

**MCP Extension Configuration (from `/docs/references/duckdb-mcp/comprehensive-guide.md`):**
```sql
-- Install and load MCP extension
INSTALL duckdb_mcp FROM community;
LOAD duckdb_mcp;

-- Configure security settings for healthcare
SET allowed_mcp_commands = '/usr/bin/python3:/usr/bin/node';
SET allowed_mcp_urls = 'https://api.census.gov:https://api.medicare.gov:file://';
```

**MCP Server Configuration (from `/docs/references/duckdb-mcp/server-functions.md`):**
```typescript
// CensusChat MCP Server Configuration
const mcpServerConfig = {
  name: "censuschat_server",
  description: "Healthcare demographics and analytics data server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  security: {
    require_auth: false,
    allowed_operations: ["read", "query", "list"]
  },
  capabilities: {
    resources: true,
    tools: true,
    prompts: true
  }
};
```

**Resource Publishing Pattern:**
```sql
-- Publish demographics table as MCP resource
SELECT mcp_publish_table(
  'demographics',
  'data://tables/demographics',
  'json',
  '{"description": "County-level demographic data with Medicare eligibility metrics"}'
);
```

**Healthcare Analytics MCP Tools:**
From `/docs/references/duckdb-mcp/server-functions.md`:
1. `calculate_medicare_eligibility` - Medicare eligibility rate calculator
2. `population_health_risk` - Population health risk assessment
3. `facility_adequacy` - Healthcare facility adequacy analysis

### Dependency on Story 2.1
**Critical Dependency:** Story 2.1 (DuckDB Connection Pool) must be completed first because:
- MCP extension requires stable DuckDB connections
- Connection pool provides the DuckDB environment for MCP operations
- Healthcare-specific DuckDB settings from Story 2.1 are required for MCP

### MCP Integration with Existing Systems

**anthropicService Integration:**
Current pattern in `query.routes.ts` line 92:
```typescript
const analysis = await anthropicService.analyzeQuery(query);
```

Enhanced pattern with MCP:
```typescript
const analysis = await anthropicService.analyzeQuery(query);
// If analysis suggests using MCP tools, call them
if (analysis.useHealthcareAnalytics) {
  const mcpResult = await mcpClientService.callTool('calculate_medicare_eligibility', parameters);
}
```

**Error Handling Integration:**
Maintain existing error patterns from `query.routes.ts`:
- Console logging with emojis for debugging
- Graceful fallback to mock data if MCP operations fail
- 2-second timeout enforcement for all MCP operations

### Security Considerations
**Healthcare Data Security (from comprehensive-guide.md):**
- HIPAA-compliant MCP configuration with BAA requirements
- OAuth 2.0 + API key authentication for external MCP access
- Data classification: PHI (restricted), Demographics (internal), Aggregated (public)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all MCP operations with 7-year retention
- Data anonymization for all externally published MCP resources
- Network segmentation for MCP server endpoints

### Performance Requirements
- MCP operations must complete within 2-second timeout
- Connection pooling for external MCP servers
- Caching for frequently accessed MCP resources
- Monitoring for MCP operation performance

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Based on CensusChat testing infrastructure:

**Test File Locations:**
- `/backend/src/__tests__/services/mcpServerService.test.ts` - MCP server tests
- `/backend/src/__tests__/services/mcpClientService.test.ts` - MCP client tests
- `/backend/src/__tests__/integration/mcp.integration.test.ts` - End-to-end MCP tests

**Testing Framework:**

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. **MCP Server Tests:** Resource publishing, tool registration, lifecycle management
2. **MCP Client Tests:** External server connections, tool calling, error handling
3. **Integration Tests:** Bidirectional communication, healthcare analytics workflows
4. **Performance Tests:** 2-second timeout compliance, concurrent MCP operations

**Mock Requirements:**
- Mock external MCP servers for testing
- Simulate MCP tool responses
- Test error scenarios and recovery

### Issues by Priority

#### 🚨 **Must Fix Before Production**

1. **Fix Test Suite Failures**:
   ```typescript
   // Fix mock setup in mcpServerService.test.ts
   beforeEach(() => {
     jest.clearAllMocks();
     // Reset mock implementations properly
     mockDuckDBPool.query.mockResolvedValue([]);
   });
   ```

2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**:
   ```typescript
   // Fix analysis property access
   const useHealthcareAnalytics = analysis.analysis.intent === 'demographics'
   ```

3. **Add Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   class MCPCircuitBreaker {
     private failures = 0;
     private readonly threshold = 5;
     private isOpen = false;

     async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
       if (this.isOpen) throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
       // Implementation...
     }
   }
   ```

#### 🟡 **Should Fix Soon**

1. **Implement MCP Operation Monitoring**:
