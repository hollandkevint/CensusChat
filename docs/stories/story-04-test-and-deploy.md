# Story: Test and Deploy Optimized Landing Page

<!-- Source: Quality assurance and deployment requirements -->
<!-- Context: Final validation and deployment of GitHub Pages optimization -->

## Status: Ready for Development

## Story

As a project maintainer,
I want comprehensive testing and safe deployment of the optimized GitHub Pages landing,
so that all visitors have a fast, functional experience without any broken features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Jekyll builds successfully without errors locally
2. ✅ Page works correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
3. ✅ All links function properly (internal and external)
4. ✅ Page loads in under 3 seconds
5. ✅ Email CTAs open correctly with pre-filled subject lines
6. ✅ GitHub Pages deployment renders all changes correctly
7. ✅ No regression in existing functionality

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context
- GitHub Pages deployment from `/docs` folder
- Jekyll processing with GitHub Pages limitations
- Multiple device types and screen sizes to support
- Email mailto links with encoded parameters

### Integration Approach
1. Comprehensive local testing before deployment
2. Progressive testing from local → branch → main
3. Multi-device and performance validation
4. Functional testing of all interactive elements

### Technical Constraints
- GitHub Pages processing limitations
- Need to maintain fast load times
- Cross-device compatibility requirements
- Email client compatibility for CTAs

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Local Jekyll Build Testing
  - [ ] Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from `/docs` directory
  - [ ] Verify build completes without errors or warnings
  - [ ] Test page renders correctly at localhost:4000
  - [ ] Validate all content sections display properly

- [ ] Task 2: Multi-Device Testing
  - [ ] Test on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - [ ] Test on tablet (iPad/Android tablet simulation)
  - [ ] Test on mobile (iPhone/Android phone simulation)
  - [ ] Verify responsive design works correctly
  - [ ] Check that content is readable on all screen sizes

- [ ] Task 3: Link and CTA Validation
  - [ ] Test all internal links navigate correctly
  - [ ] Verify external links open in new tabs
  - [ ] Test email CTAs open mail client with correct subject lines
  - [ ] Validate mailto parameter encoding works across clients
  - [ ] Check GitHub repository links work correctly

- [ ] Task 4: Performance Testing
  - [ ] Measure page load time (target: < 3 seconds)
  - [ ] Check image optimization if any images present
  - [ ] Verify no unnecessary JavaScript or CSS loading
  - [ ] Test with simulated slow connection

- [ ] Task 5: Branch Deployment Testing
  - [ ] Create test branch for deployment validation
  - [ ] Push changes to test branch
  - [ ] Verify GitHub Pages builds the test branch correctly
  - [ ] Test all functionality on live GitHub Pages preview
  - [ ] Document any GitHub Pages specific issues

- [ ] Task 6: Production Deployment
  - [ ] Get stakeholder approval for changes
  - [ ] Merge test branch to main branch
  - [ ] Monitor GitHub Pages deployment
  - [ ] Verify live site functions correctly
  - [ ] Test final URL structure and redirects

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: Deployment breaks existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing before merge to main
- **Verification**: Full functional test on live deployment

### Rollback Plan
- Git revert merge commit if issues found
- GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild from reverted state
- Keep stakeholders informed of any rollback actions

### Safety Checks
- [ ] Local build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All devices show content correctly
- [ ] No broken links or CTAs
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Test deployment validates all changes

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Jekyll builds successfully locally and on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] All links and CTAs function correctly
- [ ] Page load time under 3 seconds
- [ ] Email CTAs work across different email clients
- [ ] Live GitHub Pages deployment successful
- [ ] No regression in existing site functionality
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received for deployment
