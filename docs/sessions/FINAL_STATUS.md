## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Try Natural Language Queries

**Medicare & Seniors:**
- "Show me block groups in Florida with over 1000 Medicare-eligible seniors"
- "Find neighborhoods where seniors make up more than 30% of population"

**Vulnerable Populations:**
- "Show me block groups with poverty rates above 20% and high uninsured rates"
- "Find neighborhoods with high disability rates in Texas"

**Pediatric Care:**
- "Show me block groups in New York with over 200 children under 5"
- "Find neighborhoods with high percentages of school-age children"

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Query 239,741 Neighborhoods
Ask questions like:
- "Show me neighborhoods in [state] with [demographic criteria]"
- "Find block groups where [metric] exceeds [threshold]"
- "What's the total [population group] in [location] block groups?"

### 2. Access 35+ Variables Per Block Group
- Demographics (12): Population, age, gender, race/ethnicity
- Economic (5): Income, poverty, unemployment, uninsured rate
- Health (4): Disability, limited English, education levels
- Housing (4): Units, values, rent, ownership rates
- Transportation (2): Vehicle access, transit usage

### 3. Get Precise Geographic Analysis
- 76x more granular than counties
- Neighborhood-level targeting
- Healthcare demographic precision

## 📈 Impact Summary

### Before This Session
- County-level only (3,144 areas)
- Basic demographics (5 variables)
- Estimated Medicare populations

### After This Session
- **Block group-level** (239,741 areas)
- **35+ variables** across all categories
- **Actual age counts** (no estimates!)
- **Natural language queries** for complex analysis

---

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional)

### Test & Verify
1. ✅ Backend is updated
2. ⏳ Restart backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. ⏳ Test query via frontend
4. ⏳ Verify results accuracy

### Future Enhancements
- Add frontend geography selector (County/Block Group toggle)
- Display block group GEOID in results
- Show block group boundaries on maps
- Add materialized views for performance
- Load additional ACS variables if needed

## 💾 Data Management

### Keep These Files
- ✅ `/backend/data/census.duckdb` - Main database (contains both tables)
- ✅ All documentation in root and `/docs/guides/`
- ✅ All backend code updates

### Optional Cleanup (Reclaim ~15 MB)
```bash
# These are now redundant (data merged)
rm backend/data/census_blockgroups.duckdb
rm backend/data/blockgroup-progress.json
```
