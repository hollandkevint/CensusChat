# Block Group Queries - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Updated

Successfully enabled natural language queries for block group data! The system can now understand and query **239,741 neighborhood-level block groups** with **35+ demographic variables**.

## Files Modified

### 1. Anthropic Service Schema (`/backend/src/services/anthropicService.ts`)
**Updated Claude's system prompt with:**
- Complete block_group_data table schema (35+ columns)
- Query selection logic (when to use block groups vs counties)
- Healthcare-specific mappings using actual age columns (age_65_plus, age_75_plus, under_5, etc.)
- Geographic rules for block group queries

### 2. SQL Security Policies (`/backend/src/validation/sqlSecurityPolicies.ts`)
**Added block_group_data to security allowlist:**
- Added 'block_group_data' to allowed tables
- Whitelisted all 35 block group columns
- Updated CENSUS_SCHEMA with full block group definition

## Example Queries You Can Now Ask

### Medicare & Seniors
```
"Show me block groups in Florida with over 1000 Medicare-eligible seniors"
"Find neighborhoods in California where seniors make up more than 30% of the population"
"What's the total 75+ population in Miami block groups?"
```

### Vulnerable Populations
```
"Find block groups with high poverty and uninsured rates in Texas"
"Show me neighborhoods where poverty rate exceeds 25% and disability rate is above 15%"
"Which block groups have the highest combination of poverty, unemployment, and uninsured rates?"
```

### Pediatric & Family Health
```
"Find block groups in New York with over 200 children under 5"
"Show me neighborhoods with high percentages of school-age children"
"What's the total pediatric population in Boston block groups?"
```

### Race & Ethnicity Analysis
```
"Show me block groups in Georgia with majority Hispanic populations"
"Find neighborhoods in California with diverse racial composition"
"What's the Asian population in San Francisco block groups?"
```

### Health Equity Research
```
"Compare uninsured rates across block groups in low-income vs high-income areas"
"Find block groups where median income is below $40k and uninsured rate exceeds 20%"
"Show me disability rates by income level across block groups"
```

### Geographic Precision
```
"What's the poverty rate in block group 120710503192?"
"Show me all block groups in Dade County with population over 2000"
"Find block groups within Miami city limits with high senior populations"
```

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Backend (if running)
```bash
cd backend
# Stop current process (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Natural Language Queries

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and try queries like:

1. **Simple block group query:**
   - "Show me block groups in California with over 1000 seniors"

2. **Healthcare targeting:**
   - "Find neighborhoods in Florida with high Medicare-eligible populations"

3. **Vulnerable populations:**
   - "Show me block groups with poverty rates above 20% and uninsured rates above 15%"

4. **Pediatric focus:**
   - "Find block groups in Texas with more than 300 children under 5"

## Query Intelligence

The system now automatically:

1. **Chooses the right table:**
   - Block groups → for detailed demographics, age breakdowns, health metrics
   - Counties → for broader state/county comparisons

2. **Uses actual data columns:**
   - `age_65_plus` for Medicare-eligible (not estimates!)
   - `age_75_plus` for assisted living targeting
   - `under_5` and `age_5_17` for pediatric populations
   - `uninsured_rate`, `disability_rate` for health access

3. **Handles geography correctly:**
   - Full state names ("California" not "CA")
   - Block group GEOID format (12-digit)
   - County and state filtering

## Database Structure

**Single database**: `/backend/data/census.duckdb`

**Tables available:**
- `county_data` - 3,144 counties, 5 columns
- `block_group_data` - 239,741 block groups, 38 columns ⭐

**Sample SQL generated by the system:**
```sql
-- The system will now generate queries like:
SELECT geoid, state_name, county_name, age_65_plus, population,
       ROUND((age_65_plus::FLOAT / population * 100), 1) as senior_pct
FROM block_group_data
WHERE state_name = 'Florida'
  AND age_65_plus > 1000
ORDER BY senior_pct DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Frontend Updates:**
   - Display block group GEOID in results
   - Add geography level selector (County/Block Group)
   - Show block group boundaries on maps

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Add materialized views for common aggregations
   - Implement geographic search by radius
   - Add ZIP code to block group mapping

3. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Load additional ACS variables if needed
   - Add temporal data (multiple years)
   - Integrate with external healthcare datasets
