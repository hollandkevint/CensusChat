# Database Merge Complete ✅

## What Was Done

Successfully merged block group data into the main census database (`census.duckdb`).

## Database Structure

**File**: `/backend/data/census.duckdb`

### Tables Available

1. **county_data** - County-level demographics (3,144 records)
   - 51 states/territories
   - 8 columns: state, county, state_name, county_name, population, median_income, poverty_rate, last_updated

2. **block_group_data** - Block group demographics (239,741 records) ⭐ NEW
   - 51 states/territories
   - 38 columns including:
     - Geographic: geoid, state_fips, county_fips, tract_fips, block_group, state_name, county_name
     - Demographics: population, median_age, male_population, female_population
     - Age groups: under_5, age_5_17, age_18_64, age_65_plus, age_75_plus
     - Race/ethnicity: white_alone, black_alone, asian_alone, hispanic_latino
     - Economic: median_household_income, per_capita_income, poverty_rate, unemployment_rate, uninsured_rate
     - Education: high_school_or_higher_pct, bachelors_or_higher_pct
     - Housing: total_housing_units, median_home_value, median_rent, renter_occupied_pct
     - Health: disability_rate, limited_english_pct
     - Transportation: no_vehicle_pct, public_transit_pct

### Performance Indexes Created

**Block Group Indexes:**
- `idx_bg_geoid` - Primary key lookups
- `idx_bg_state` - State filtering
- `idx_bg_county` - County filtering
- `idx_bg_state_fips` - FIPS code lookups
- `idx_bg_age_65_plus` - Medicare-eligible queries
- `idx_bg_poverty` - Poverty analysis
- `idx_bg_uninsured` - Health insurance queries
- `idx_bg_population` - Population filtering

**County Indexes:**
- `idx_county_state_fips` - FIPS code lookups
- `idx_county_state_name` - State filtering
- `idx_county_name` - County name queries
- `idx_county_population` - Population filtering

## How to Access

```bash
cd backend
npm run duckdb
```

This now opens the merged database with both county and block group data.

## Sample Queries

### Find High Medicare-Eligible Block Groups
```sql
SELECT geoid, state_name, county_name, age_65_plus, population,
       ROUND((age_65_plus::FLOAT / population * 100), 1) as senior_pct
FROM block_group_data
WHERE age_65_plus > 500
ORDER BY senior_pct DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Compare County vs Block Group Granularity
```sql
-- County level: 3,144 geographic areas
SELECT COUNT(*) as counties FROM county_data;

-- Block group level: 239,741 geographic areas (76x more!)
SELECT COUNT(*) as block_groups FROM block_group_data;
```

### Identify Vulnerable Populations at Block Group Level
```sql
SELECT geoid, state_name, county_name,
       poverty_rate, uninsured_rate, disability_rate,
       population
FROM block_group_data
WHERE poverty_rate > 20
  AND uninsured_rate > 15
  AND population > 100
ORDER BY poverty_rate DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Aggregate Block Groups to County Level
```sql
SELECT
  state_name,
  county_name,
  COUNT(*) as block_groups,
  SUM(population) as total_population,
  ROUND(AVG(poverty_rate), 2) as avg_poverty_rate,
  ROUND(AVG(uninsured_rate), 2) as avg_uninsured_rate
FROM block_group_data
GROUP BY state_name, county_name
HAVING total_population > 10000
ORDER BY avg_poverty_rate DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Query Routes (Required)

Modify `/backend/src/routes/query.routes.ts` to:
- Add `block_group_data` table to the schema
- Update Claude's system prompt to understand block group geography
- Support queries like "show me block groups in Florida with high poverty"

### 2. Update Database Connection

The app currently connects to `census.duckdb` which now has both tables, so no connection changes needed.

### 3. Test Natural Language Queries

Once query routes are updated, users can ask:
- "Show me block groups in California with over 1000 seniors"
- "Find neighborhoods in Texas with high uninsured rates"
- "What's the poverty rate in block group 120710503192?"

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/backend/data/census.duckdb` - Merged database (now includes block_group_data)
- ✅ `/backend/scripts/merge-databases.sql` - Merge script
- ✅ `/backend/scripts/create-indexes.sql` - Performance indexes
- ✅ `/DATABASE_MERGE_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## Old Files (Can Be Deleted)

- `/backend/data/census_blockgroups.duckdb` - Source data (now merged, can delete to save space)
- `/backend/data/blockgroup-progress.json` - Load progress tracking (no longer needed)

## Database Size

- Before merge: `census.duckdb` (~2 MB)
- After merge: `census.duckdb` (~15-20 MB)
- Can delete: `census_blockgroups.duckdb` (~15 MB) to reclaim space

---

**Status**: ✅ Database merge complete and tested
**Next Action**: Update query routes to enable natural language queries on block group data
